# Development
- **4.24.20** - Implemented library and wrote starting code to test if it was working.
- **4.26.20** - Wrote working code for LU decomposition and the permutation matrix.
    - Still need to fix RREF computations and work on printing out the matrix. 
    - Need to make size dynamic and figure out how to implement matrix inputting.
- **4.28.20** - Worked on the front end.
    - Still need to understand how I will create a list of problems for the user to choose from. 
    - Found out I need to use ImGui for the UI.
