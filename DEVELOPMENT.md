# Development
- **4.24.20** - Implemented library and wrote starting code to test if it was working.
- **4.26.20** - Wrote working code for LU decomposition and the permutation matrix.
    - Still need to fix RREF computations and work on printing out the matrix. 
    - Need to make size dynamic and figure out how to implement matrix inputting.
- **4.28.20** - Worked on the front end.
    - Still need to understand how I will create a list of problems for the user to choose from. 
    - Found out I need to use ImGui for the UI.
- **5.1.2020** - Fixed the linker error.
    - Still need to create the entire front end and work with IMGUI.
    - Still need to fix and add more computations.
- **5.2.2020** - Successfully created a functional menu, that would call computations using the a test input matrix.
    - Added functionality to more computations.
    - Need to add draw functions to output answers when problem types are clicked from the menu.
    - Need to add functionality to the InputMatrix() function.
- **5.3.2020** - Fixed problems with the menu. Allowed user to input dimension. Created more computations to choose from (Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors).
    - Successfully implemented matrix inputting from the user.
    - Implemented functionality for the draw functions.
    - Need to add a back to menu button.
    - Need to implement functionality for the remaining computations.
- **5.4.2020** - Implemented remaining computations. Made the program completely functional.
    - Added the back to menu functionality.
    - Need to clean up code and remove magic numbers.
- **5.5.2020** -Tested computations, and cleaned code. 
    - Used enums to replace magic numbers. 
    - Added function documentation.
    - Might add some extensions to the project, like making the matrix input not only for square matrices.
    - Still need to finalize code and make project perfectly presentable.
    - Need to work on README.md
- **5.6.2020** -Completed project.
