The Matrix Machine is a program that computes the answer to several types of problems in linear algebra that involve matrix inputs. 
##Computations
The computations that are included are - 
- Row Space Calculations.
- Column Space Calculations. 
- Row Reduced Echelon Form Calculations.
- Determinant Calculations.
- LU Decomposition.
- QR Decomposition.
- Permutation Matrix Computation.
- Inverse Calculations.
- Matrix Multiplications. 
- Dot Produce Computation.
- Eigen Value Computations.
- Eigen Vector Computation. 

##Input format
The input matrices are restricted to square dimensions.
The inputting happens in a single line, where the matrix elements would be inputted one by one separated by a space, going in a row wise order.

##Dependencies 
- [cmake](https://cmake.org/)
- [Imgui](https://github.com/simongeilfus/Cinder-ImGui) 
- [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/)
