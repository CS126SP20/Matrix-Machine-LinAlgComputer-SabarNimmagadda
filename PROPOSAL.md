# [THE MATRIX MACHINE]

Author: [Sabar Nimmagadda]

  The project has the basic functionality of being able to solve several types of problems in the field of linear algebra, for square matrices. 
The basic structure is built around the user inputting the type of problem they need solved, and the data required to
solve the problem, and the computer shall output the solution in whichever form required.
This project will should be able to convert matrices into their reduced row echelon forms, and the output the resulting
matrix. It should be able to output row spaces, column spaces, find eigen values, and eigen vectors, and it should be able to do LU decompositions and find the inverse of matrices. 

  The library I would use is Eigen, this is a library for higher levelled linear algebraic computations. The link to the documentation of this library https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/
 .
 The library I will use for the user interface is Imgui : https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.

  The background I have on this project is MATH 415, I know how to do all of these computations, and I want to do this
as my project because it would make homework in Math 415 a lot easier. 

  In my first week, I want to set up the layout for all of the different types of classes for the different kinds of computations.
I would like to implement as many as I can. In week 2, I'll wrap up the computations and begin working on the user interface. In week 3,
I would like to put everything together. If I finish early I shall show steps for computations as my extension.
